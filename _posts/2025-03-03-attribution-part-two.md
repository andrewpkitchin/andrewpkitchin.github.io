**tracking the invisible**

Programmatic events let us capture user actions as they navigate our digital spaces. Rather than relying on basic server logs or simple page counters, developers strategically implement event tracking that activates whenever something meaningful happens.

*"If you can't measure it, you can't improve it." - Peter Drucker*

These event records capture the essence of user behavior: what happened (a "purchase"), when it happened (timestamp), who did it (user ID), and the context around it (product details, page URL). This structured data allows us to reconstruct user journeys and understand their path to conversion.

**the dual vision of events**

On the product side, these breadcrumbs reveal where users stumble and where they glide through. On the marketing side, they connect the dots from first encounter to final conversion, exposing which channels actually work - not just which ones claim to work.

**client-side tracking**

In the browser, JavaScript handles the event recording:

```javascript
// Track what happens in the browser
function logPageView() {
    const event = {
        event_type: 'page_view',
        page_url: window.location.href,
        referrer: document.referrer || null,
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        user_id: getCookie('user_id') || null
    };
    // Send the event data to our analytics service
    fetch('https://analytics.example.com/collect', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(event)
    });
}
```

This snippet creates a structured record of the interaction - capturing what the user is viewing, their referral source, when they arrived, and their identity if available. Then it sends this data back to our analytics system.

**server-side logging**

Sometimes the server needs to maintain its own event records, either for verification purposes or because client-side tracking might be incomplete:

```python
def log_conversion(user_id, conversion_name, metadata=None):
    event = {
        "event_type": conversion_name,
        "user_id": user_id,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
        "metadata": metadata or {}
    }
    # Write the event to our log file
    with open("events.log", "a") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(event) + "\n")
```

**signal and noise**

*"The best is the enemy of the good." - Voltaire*

Not everything should be tracked. Over-tracking creates noise that obscures meaningful patterns, while under-tracking leaves gaps in our understanding. Effective tracking requires thoughtful planning - deciding what to include and what to omit.

Teams maintain "tracking plans" that document all event types and their properties, outlining which user actions are significant enough to record.

**the foundation of attribution**

Programmatic event logging is the foundation upon which attribution models are built. Without this structured event data, we'd have no way to connect marketing efforts to outcomes, no way to resolve the attribution war I mentioned in my previous post.

In my next post, I'll explore how this event infrastructure adapts to the unique challenges of mobile apps, and how the walled gardens of big tech use these same techniques to build their attribution claims.
